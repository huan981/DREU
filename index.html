          <hr>
          <p>This week was a lot of fun! On day one, I got to meet up with Professor Kumar, as well as my other lab members, Yichen and Liza. We were able to grab lunch and discuss what projects were were most interested in during one-on-one
            sessions. I decided to work on Prof. Kumar’s ongoing fashion project with Yichen, where we are is aiming to design the future of personal fashion via machine learning.
            <br />
            <br />
            A lot of our initial work consisted of reading papers, as well as learning how various programs such as mail chimp and type form worked. Most importantly however, we determined what factors consumers care about when selecting clothing,
            such as color, price, versatility and appropriateness for a certain event. I created a mock HCI storyboard, and came up with various scenarios of user queries and accompanying product recommendations. We plan to conduct a user study to
            determine which of these factors are most important to users. The results will ultimately allow us to make the best recommendations to users, and map the observable attributes of a product (such as material, price and color) to the more
            organic factors like the fit for an ’occasion’, the user’s ‘body type’, or ’skin tone.’
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition, we had our first tutorial on Saturday, in which we were introduced to web crawlers. I will be programming my own crawler in Python for a specific clothing site that will return product details such as name, price and more.
