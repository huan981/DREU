          <hr />
          <p>This week was largely devoted to working on the UI in React. I decided to use a styling library called Material UI to help me with the creation. Through the process, I learned the importance of making reusable components (especially when
            you have tons of product cards), passing in props between components, callback functions, and async/await. It is definitely still a challenge, but it is a fun one nonetheless. Seeing your designs transform into an actual, usable web
            application is pretty cool. Thursday was the fourth of July, so we got a bit of a break! Towards the end of the week I started learning about Axios and making AJAX requests to servers, so hopefully all the functionality will start coming
            together next week.
            <br />
            </br />
            This week’s luncheon featured Tianyin Xu and Sasa Misailovic, who talked about presentation and verbal communication skills. One thing they emphasized is presenting simple yet striking slides. The more words, the more they can dilute your
            presentation. On the other hand, images, graphs and short sentences can really bring the focus back to the presenter him/herself and what they are talking about.

          <hr />
          <p>This week, I worked primarily on the UI design, and learning Sketch in the process. While I’ve done graphics before in Illustrator, I quickly realized that wire framing and designing the entire interface is much different—there are so
            many more considerations. For example, one of my first iterations looked basically like a typical e-commerce site. While it looked okay, after talking to my team, I quickly realized that it didn’t achieve the goals we had in mind. We
            wanted to present users with an improved search in terms of experience, and not just design. In particular, for the study, we wanted to see whether displaying justifications next to product images would make a difference, vs just an image
            and no justification. But how do we achieve that without overcrowding the product page and making users read blocks of text? What visual cues can we provide so that users know they can search this, or click that? How do we create an
            effective visual hierarchy, encouraging users to focus on the justification rather than the picture, price and brand?
            <br />
            </br />
            All questions that need to be addressed. To better do so, we decided to focus on the product cards only, rather than all of the pages. After many more iterations, I’ve come up with some new designs. These will likely continue develop over
            the next few weeks. One mistake I definitely made was jumping straight to a prototype instead of basic wireframing. Since people are consistently coming up with new ideas, I have to consistently edit my designs, and all of the details
            (color, font, weight, etc) make it a lot more time consuming to adjust, versus a bare-bones, black and white wireframe. Good things to keep in mind for the future!
            <br />
            </br />
            In addition to working extensively on the UI, I’ve been learning Javascript, Node.js and how web applications work. My original assignment was actually to learn React, but after jumping in last week, I quickly realized that I needed at
            least some background in Javascript and web development basics to be an effective learner. This week I backpedaled a little bit, but building a good foundation will be much more beneficial for my learning process.
            At this week’s REU lunch, Professor Tandy Warnow talked about writing and publishing research papers. Some of the main points she went over: dealing with rejection, plagiarism, reading critically, what to do if you find mistakes in your
            paper, and how to avoid those mistakes in the first place.

            This week, I finished up and submitted my Python web crawler. Towards the end, I was stuck on two main problems a) dealing with infinite scroll and b) how to retrieve different color swatches (by clicking on buttons) when the URL didn’t
            change. Luckily, grad students Yuan and Yuliang were able to work with me to figure out the issues. While there are still a few bugs (too many edge cases! the crawler is basically complete—the main goal is to get most (not necessarily
            all) products from each site.
            <br />
            <br />
            Next up, I started learning React. It’s honestly pretty difficult, since I don’t have a lot of background in web development and Javascript. I’ve been following online tutorials as well as reading the documentation for React and ES6.
            Hopefully more practice will help!

            On Sunday, we went to a team dinner at Chinatown Buffet. It was a fun night and I got to meet some of the other group members (working on different projects) that I hadn’t seen previously.

          <p>Happy Friday!
            Things have started settling down this week, as the final interns have joined and begun the on boarding process. Professor Kumar and I have decided on two weekly meetings: one on Monday afternoon, and the second on Thursday evenings. The
            Monday meetings are dedicated to discussing the actual fashion research project, reviewing the work we did over the week, and setting new goals. The Thursday meetings are lab-wide. The first half is dedicated to updates, where each group
            talks a bit about what they’ve been working on. During the second half, Yuan, a graduate student, holds a mini tutorial for us in which he teaches us a new skill!
            <br />
            <br />
            This Monday’s meeting was particularly productive. We reviewed the mock survey Yichen and I had designed. In the mock survey, we planned to ask about things such as the user’s clothing preferences (brand preferences, price range, colors),
            and asking them to describe a fashion problem they’d like to solve. At the end, we’d give them the option to provide more personal information, such as hair color and skin tone, which would allow us to produce a more personalized result.
            This question had two purposes: to try and create more meaningful product recommendations (such as skin tone-color combos), but to also gauge if users were willing to give up that information in the first place.
            After discussing our survey, Professor Kumar and I honed in on one aspect. Having Yichen and I generate the explanations by hand—acting as the temporary stylists— might not only be time consuming, but also lack consistency. Could we
            automate the process? Professor Kumar already had a database of ~2000 key words commonly used to describe clothing, such as the color, silhouette and material. We figured that the best solution would be to initially map these keywords—or
            physical attributes of clothing —to more organic explanations by hand. For example, the key word ‘high-waisted’ could be mapped to ‘high-waisted bottoms are great at elongating your figure’. We could then use these phrases to construct a
            complete explanation. While mapping 2000 words seems like a lot, it is ultimately much more productive than trying to come up with an explanation by hand for every unique scenario. If this product were implemented, we could consult
            professional stylists for the mapping portion.
            We also talked about the possibility of creating a browser plug in, which would generate these explanations as you browsed clothing sites and indicated interest in a certain product.
            <br />
            <br />
            During Thursday’s tutorial, we learned the basics of Amazon Web Services, more commonly known as AWS. As someone who’s very new to cloud computing, it was a bit hard to follow along at first, but fascinating nonetheless. We learned 5
            basic skills: creating instances, stopping and deleting instances, using ssh into an AWS from our local machines, the scp command for transferring large files between local machines and an AWS instances, as well s the screen command for
            running processes in the background on an AWS instance. I also got to meet some new lab members who are PhD students!
            <br />
            <br />
            Besides the meetings, I spent a lot of time this week setting up my DREU website, as well as working on my first web crawler in Python. I decided to crawl Uniqlo’s site. It’s been a little stressful, as I didn’t have any exposure to
            programming in Python before Sunday. I went through an online Python bootcamp to learn the basics, then went to work on my crawler. I do wish I had more of a foundation/experience in Python before beginning my crawler, but I can make that
            one of my goals this summer. As for the DREU site, it was great to familiarize myself with the Bootstrap library. I also really enjoyed making it look visually appealing—I’ll probably continue to update the site’s design throughout the
            summer!
            <br />
            <br />
            The weather in Champaign-Urbana has been a little cooler lately, but I’m actually enjoying it a lot. There’s nothing better than grabbing frozen yogurt after work and enjoying it on the Main Quad! I got to grab coffee with Liza on
            Thursday and work on our DREU websites together, which was quite nice :).

          <p class="blog-post-meta blog-date">06.03.19 - 06.08.19</p>
          <hr>
          <p>This week was a lot of fun! On day one, I got to meet up with Professor Kumar, as well as my other lab members, Yichen and Liza. We were able to grab lunch at Sakanaya and discuss what projects were were most interested in during
            one-on-one sessions. I decided to work on Prof. Kumar’s ongoing fashion project with Yichen, where we are aiming to design the future of personal fashion via machine learning.
            <br />
            <br />
            During the first week, we read several papers: one of Professor Kumar’s own publications, as well as a paper on generating justifications for users in self driving cars. We also familiarized ourselves with online programs such as
            MailChimp and Typeform, which will be useful when conducting studies later on. Most importantly, we discussed what factors consumers care about when selecting clothing—such as color, price, versatility and appropriateness for a certain
            event. I created a mock HCI storyboard, and came up with various scenarios of user queries and accompanying product recommendations. We plan to conduct a user study to determine which of these factors are most important to users. The
            results will ultimately allow us to make the best recommendations to users, and map the observable attributes of a product (such as material, price and color) to the more organic factors like the fit for an ’occasion’, the user’s ‘body
            type’, or ’skin tone.’ To be authorized to conduct the surveys, we worked on completing the CITI Research Ethics and Compliance Training course.
            <br />
            <br />
            We also had our first technical tutorial on Saturday, where graduate student Yuan introduced us to web crawlers and walked us through a bit of his code. I’ve never had exposure to a) Python or b) data scrapping, but it should be super
            interesting! Our job is to program our own crawlers for a specific clothing site. We briefly discussed what sites might be better than others for web crawling, and despite there being a general template, we will have to deal with edge
            cases for every unique site. The web crawler consists of functions that can return information about a product, a list of all products, prices, URLs and more.
            <br />
            <br />
            The first program luncheon was also held on Wednesday. A lot of people from the REU program turned up, and we had empanadas while learning about what research is like, how it differs from industry, and how to get started!
