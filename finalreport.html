            Since the beginning of the summer, a lot has changed about our research project.
            Originally, we aimed to focus on the personalization aspect of the search engine. However, we ended up focusing on another aspect of improving the online shopping experience—by  explaining fashion recommendations with AI justifications.
            <br>
            <br>
            These days, online shopping experiences seem pretty consistent across the board. Nordstrom, Amazon, Uniqlo—they all have a search bar and a side panel with numerous filters  to narrow the products displayed. However, when presented with this interface, consumers can begin to experience choice paralysis. A single query often returns thousands of products, and navigating the space can be overwhelming and time consuming.
            <br>
            <br>
            Our goal was to improve the user experience, especially for individuals who may not be super familiar with fashion or their personal style. We came up with a feature called “justifications”, which are short, AI-generated explanations as to why a certain product fits the user’s query. For example, if a user searched for “summer dress”, we would point to features such as a dress’ “nautical pattern” or “linen material” that make it a perfect choice. By implementing these justifications, we hope to help the user make more informed choices, and help them discover their style by using fashion vocabulary to describe products.
            <br>
            <br>
            We ended up building our own search engine from scratch. I was responsible for designing the UI in Sketch, implementing the front-end in React, and designing the user study. In addition, I learned a great deal about machine learning, training a model, and writing web crawlers in the process. Towards the end of the summer, we finished the search engine and it was ready to be tested. While we originally aimed to complete a user study—to see if a) the justifications are useful and b) if they affect the user’s perception of the model’s intelligence—we were unable to do so. However, it will still be carried out after the program is over. With the feedback from the study, we will be well equipped to explore many other questions about the online shopping experience. What is the most effective way to present these justifications on the front-end? Can our model learn how to return better results or justifications over time? How can we ultimately use AI to construct a better user experience?
            <br>
            <br>
            The future of this project is exciting, as we are exploring the largely unchartered space between AI and HCI. I’m excited to continue working  (remotely) on the project and building up my web development skills in the process!
